<h1>neopixel-gui</h1>

<p>Simple graphical interface for controlling neopixel RGB LEDs on a Raspberry Pi</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This project is currently work in progress. More documentation will be provided in future.</p>

<h2>GUI Layout</h2>

<p>The user interface is intentionally basic in appearance using large buttons. This is so that it is suitable for use in a disco environment using a touchscreen (eg. using VNC from a touchscreen laptop).</p>

<p>The Apply button needs to be pressed for the changes to take effect, which allows the user to choose all the appropriate settings prior to applying them.</p>
